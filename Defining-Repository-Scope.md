# Introduction
Managing a repository service includes tasks that focus on defining the service, collection, and audience of the repository service. Defining the scope of a repository will facilitate the success of the service, by ensuring that the content collected will meet the needs of the intended users, and that the infrastructure will support the interaction between the users and the content. The section below scoping the content contained within the repository, the communities served by the repository, and the infrastructure the supports the repository; the issues will be discussed in more depth in subsequent sections of the handbook.

# Intellectual content
Understanding what content is included in your repository clarifies the boundaries of your repository service. The collecting scope could be discipline or topically specific, format specific, or audience specific. A clear collecting focus will help shape consequent decisions around infrastructure, metadata needs, copyright concerns, preservation strategies, outreach, and service planning.  

* Identify content to be included in collection    
* Identify content that could be excluded from collection.
* Identify any mandates or existing guidelines for content to be included in your collection.
* Write a collecting policy that describes the content your repository does and does not collect.

# Content formats
Different repository systems and structures store and deliver different sorts of content with various levels of utility: whether using an existing system or starting from scratch, you need to make sure the provided functionality matches your (and your audience's) needs. Examples of different content types include documents, images, video, multimedia exhibits, etc. It's important to note whether you will need to deliver multiple kinds of formats through the same system. 

RepoExec can help by working with you to determine whether any extant system(s) already house and/or deliver the kind of content you're working with. If such a system exists, you may be able to incorporate your content into it. If there is no extant internal system that meets the needs of you and your audience, RepoExec can help you find one that does. 

* Identify the range of format types to be included in the repository.
* Use the CUL Repository Inventory, or consultation with the Repository Executive Group, to determine whether these content types are already delivered through an existing system.
* Contact the Repository Executive Group to identify and evaluate systems which can handle the content types you have identified, and best deliver that content to your audience. 

# Active and passive content collection
The two broad categories of collection for a repository are active collecting and passive collection. Active collecting involves repository staff identifying, acquiring, preparing, and uploading (ingesting) material to the repository. Passive collection has that work done by individuals or groups external to the repository staff. 

* Determine whether your repository will engage in active collecting, passive collection, or a combination.
 
 If your repository will engage with active collecting:

* Identify the staff responsible for each stage of the process: identification, acquisition, preparation, and upload (ingest).  
* Determine workflow(s) for this process.

If your repository will engage with passive collection:

* Determine what community(ies) will support your passive collection. This may be the same as or differ from your access community(ies).
* Determine how repository service will engage with identified communities. Complete the outreach section of the handbook.
* Identify the systems that will allow external actors to add material to the repository.
* Determine the safeguards necessary to vet content from external actors.

# User communities
Defining your primary community(ies) who will be accessing the content helps guide infrastructure and development decisions. Even if the content may be available to everyone, there are still targeted audiences for the content and functions of the repository. (Everybody is not a good answer.)  

One of the main purposes of establishing a digital repository is to facilitate broad access to content, so it is important to determine who you are trying to reach. Some issues to consider:

*Does access need to be restricted to a certain community?* If so, some system of access control needs to be included in your repository system. Common restrictions include logins, IP restrictions, or limitation to use by the Cornell community. Sometimes only parts of your collection will require such restrictions under certain conditions. Make this determination, and then make sure that this functionality is supported by any repository technology you choose. There are two general approaches to managing access. First, the content is considered open unless there is a reason to for it to be restricted. Second, the content is considered restricted unless certain conditions allow it to be open. Different repository infrastructures are structured to make one of these approaches more viable than the other.

*What use cases do you anticipate for this content?* It's important to identify clearly how you see your audience interacting with this content; download and/or viewing are the most common, but not the only possibilities. Make a list of the different interactions your audience may have with the content, and use that to evaluate the systems you're looking at.

*Is this audience already served by an existing repository?* If there's already a repository at CUL that serves this audience, it's worth examining it's functionality in light of the other issues on this list. We have a lot of repositories at Cornell, and there is no need to reinvent the wheel if you can use a system that is already in place.

* Identify designated community for content in repository.
* Identify whether designated community is supported by an existing repository within Cornell.
* Identify whether designated community is supported by an existing repository external to Cornell.
* Identify types of access controls (what does this even mean?) based on content and designated community.
* Identify anticipated use of content based on designated community(ies).
* Identify potential ways the community(ies) may interact with the content.
* Prioritize the potential interactions with content to help guide development.
* Communicate with designated community(ies) as needed to answer the above questions.

# Assessment of existing repositories
Cornell already has a number of repositories; there are also many external subject repositories. Identifying gaps in collecting areas at other repositories may be an opportunity to talk with a repository that could easily fill the collections gap or provide a slightly broader range of services rather than building an entirely new repository.  

If existing repositories are unable to fill the gap, articulate your collecting scope within this gap as part of your repository's mission.

If there is overlap between collections and communities, it may save you on development time and money to participate in an existing repository that may require small modifications to support your collections and community(ies).

* Survey repositories for those with similar collections.
* Survey repositories for those serving similar communities or audiences.
* Determine if an existing repository serves all or most collections and audiences. If so reach out to repository service manager and have a conversation about expanding scope of existing service.   
* Consider cost/benefit of starting new service vs. expanding current service.

* Interoperability 
It is also important to consider how your repository will interact with other services, both those maintained by Cornell and those beyond. Many of these issues will be covered in other sections of the handbook, but it is important to begin thinking about them now.

For example: how will your audience discover the material in your repository? Will they use library's discovery layer, Google, both, something else entirely? How will the content you've been entrusted with be preserved? Will the repository have a standard means of displaying content to your audience, or will you need specialized systems or exhibits for some collections? All of these questions will necessitate certain design and implementation decisions, and will often involve working with established groups within the organization.
