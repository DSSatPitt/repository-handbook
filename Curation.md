# Curation

## Introduction

Content within a repository requires selection and management over time in order to support the identified communities. This work includes developing relationships with the appropriate content stewards and determining whether the content needs to be created from analog originals or if it exists in an appropriate digital format already.

## Intellectual stewardship
All content needs both an initial assessment and periodic review to assure its scholarly value to the institution, and its suitability to fulfill the library's scholarly mission.  Additionally, digital content requires frequent re-housing in new architectures, and re-evaluation for long term accessibility.  Mitigating threats to digital content often require balancing pros and cons of different technological strategy, gains vs loss.  Intellectual stewards inform that process through their expertise as representatives of the scholarly community and the intellectual value of the content itself, and can function as an able co-pilot when making important choices related to migration, discovery and display, and end-of-life assessment.  Decisions evaluating the content's value should not be left to the technical support team.

- [ ] Reach out to selectors, curators, archivists and/or other specialists as appropriate for your content to connect their skills and knowledge to the content in your repository.
- [ ] Create and assign role(s) of intellectual steward/curator for each collecting areas represented in the repository.  Assign these leveraging the expertise of selectors, and in a way that is resistant to institutional change (obtain buy-in that role conveys with position).  
- [ ] Maintain relationships between and repository manager and intellectual stewards/curators.  
  - [ ] Develop contact lists (elists, group addresses) for communication about changes in repositories, and use them.
  - [ ] Reach out to intellectual stewards/curators at key times (migrations, upgrades, systems failures, etc.) and solicit advice and help in managing community expectations.   
  - [ ] Partnering with intellectual stewards, consider whether each collection is worth preserving.  Digital preservation is a significantly costly process, and not all content will likely be worth this effort.  
- [ ] Maintain these relationships with regular communication.  Include regular check-ins about collecting scope.  
- [ ] Draw upon these relationships at key times where users communities are impacted - during interface changes, content migrations, technological end-of-life  (both systems and formats), system downtime and upgrades, etc.

## Digitizing content
If the content already exists in digital format, then your main concern will be evaluating the quality of the digital objects against what is needed for the chosen system.

If the content is not yet digital, then you will need a plan to digitize it. If your unit has in-house digitization capabilities, you will need to prepare a digitization plan. If your unit lacks such facilities, then you need to reach out to campus partners to identify opportunities for partnership.

- [ ] Determine how much of your targeted content exists in a non-digital format.
- [ ] Compare your digitization needs to the digitization capabilities of your library or unit.
- [ ] Review current digitization best practices for your content.
- [ ] Develop digitization workflows.   
- [ ] If the needs exceed in-house capabilities, contact other units to discuss digitization options.

## Analog material and digital surrogates
Digitizing analog content helps expand access and may support preservation of the analog material. However, it should be clear to users of the digital content A.) that it is digitized from a non-digital original and B.) how they can find the original analog material.

Additionally, if the analog content is discoverable in other managed discovery environments, there should be some documentation describing that it has been digitized and how to access the digital surrogates. This two-way relationship between analog and digitized content supports preservation of your digital material.

- [ ] Identify system(s) where analog content is already discoverable.
- [ ] Determine what metadata is needed to define relationships between analog content and digital surrogates. Complete Metadata section of this manual.
- [ ] Consider how evolution of discovery systems and records may affect implicit or explicit relationships of analog content and their digital surrogates over time.

## Metadata
Once you have identified the content that will be included in your repository, it is vital to determine whether there is any extant descriptive metadata associated with that content. Depending on what you are working with, you may have access to extensive descriptive metadata or virtually none; it may be in a format that can be easily utilized for the repository or require extensive coding or conversion; and even extensive metadata may not include the fields needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the repository.  

Depending on the specific needs of the repository and/or your unit, you may not be personally responsible for making decisions about descriptive metadata, let alone implementing them. But as a repository manager, you are responsible for making sure those decisions have been made.

- [ ] Identified the extant descriptive, administrative, structural, and/or technical metadata associated with the content for your repository.  
- [ ] Completed the Metadata section of this manual.    
- [ ] Set up an appointment with a metadata librarian to discuss extant metadata, and the metadata needs of the repository.

## Identifying content creators and rights holders
Digitizing content will often require an investigation of who holds copyright to that content; adding such content to a repository **always** requires such an investigation. Making this determination is a key prerequisite to any repository process . If you don't know who owns the rights to the content, you should consult with a Copyright Office or other copyright expert at your library to help make that determination. Once you have identified the rights holders, it is vital to obtain their permission before moving forward with the digitization and dissem in ation of the content.

- [ ] Complete the Rights Management section of this manual.
- [ ] Contact copyright experts for training on how to identify rights holders and obtain permissions.
- [ ] Identify rights holders for repository content.
