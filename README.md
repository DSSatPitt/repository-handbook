# The Repository Handbook
A working version of Cornell's Repository Handbook, intended to be cloned and used for repository managers to use locally.

# What is it?
We are using [Cornell's Repository Handbook](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/Cornell+University+Library+Repository+Principles+and+Strategies+Handbook ) to update our instutitutional repository policies and processes at the Unviersity of Pittsburgh. We also intend to allow the forking of this repository for use by other universities for similar projects.  

We used most of the text from the original handbook in this Github version, but stripped out much of the Cornell-specific information (except where it was used as examples). 

The idea is that repository managers can make a local working copy of this and update each category and question with their own information and policy specific to their institution. 

# Who is in charge?
This project was undertaken by John Fudrow (Repository Librarian) and Lauren Collister (Director of Scholarly Communication) at the University Library System, University of Pittsburgh. Most of the original text belongs to the team at Cornell who wrote it originally. Those folks are: Erin	Faulder, Jim	DelRosso, Jenn	Colt, Dianne	Dietrich, Amy	Dygert, Sarah	Kennedy, Zsuzsa	Koltay, Jason	Kovari, Wendy	Kozlowski, Chris	Manly, and Michelle	Paolillo. A PDF version of the final project output by the Cornell Team with this attribution is available at [Cornell's eCommons repository](https://hdl.handle.net/1813/57034).
